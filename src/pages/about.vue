    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hi! I'm a front-end developer and multimedia design student passionate about
      creating clean, minimalist, and user-centered digital experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      This portfolio showcases my journey, the projects I've built, and the skills I'm developing
      as I continue learning modern web technologies.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love building intuitive interfaces, experimenting with animations,
      and designing products that feel simple, modern, and meaningful.
